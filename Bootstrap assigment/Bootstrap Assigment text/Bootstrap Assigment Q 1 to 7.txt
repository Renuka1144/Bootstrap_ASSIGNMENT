Q.2)What is Bootstrap Container?How does its work?
Ans)Bootstrap containers are a fundamental part of the Bootstrap grid system, which is used for creating responsive and 
        mobile-first web layouts. 
        Containers are used to wrap site contents and provide consistent padding and margins. They ensure proper alignment
        and padding of the contentwithin them, and also help in centering the content on the page.

       In Bootstrap, there are two types of containers: .container and .container-fluid. The .container class creates a 
       responsive fixed-width container, while
       the .container-fluid class creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport.

      The way they work is by providing a consistent way to structure and organize content on a web page, making it easier
      to create responsive and visually appealing layouts across different devices and screen sizes. By using containers, 
      developers can ensure that their content is properly aligned and spaced, regardless of the device being used to view 
      the website.

Q:3)What are the default Bootstrap text settings?
Ans)Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, provides default text settings that define the typography for various HTML
        elements. The default text settings in Bootstrap typically include the following:

1. Base Font Size and Line Height:
   - The base font size is set to 16px (1rem).
   - The line height is set to 1.5, which means the line height is 1.5 times the font size.

2. Body Text:
   - The default font family for body text is usually a system font stack like Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.
   - The color of body text is typically #212529 (a dark grey).

     - h3: 1.75rem font size (equivalent to 28px).
     - h4: 1.5rem font size (equivalent to 24px).
     - h5: 1.25rem font size (equivalent to 20px).
     - h6: 1rem font size (equivalent to 16px).

   - Visited links are styled with #6610f2 (a different shade of blue).

6. Inline Text Elements:
   - Inline elements like <strong>, <em>, and <small> have predefined styles for font weight and size.

7. Blockquote and Lists:
   - <blockquote> and <ul>/<ol> elements have specific margins and padding applied for spacing.

Q.5)What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid system?
Ans)Grid System: Bootstrap Grid System allows up to 12 columns across the page. You can use each of them individually
        or merge them together for wider columns. You can use all combinations of values summing up to 12. You can use 12 columns
        each of width 1, or use 4 columns each of width 3 or any other combination. 
        The Bootstrap grid system has four classes that can be combined to make more flexible layouts:
                                                       xs (<576px): For Portrait Mobile Phones.

Q.7)What is Button Group and what is the class for Button Group?
Ans)A Button Group in Bootstrap is a group of buttons that are visually grouped together and styled as a cohesive unit. This allows for organizing
       related buttons into a single unit, making them appear as part of the same control group. Button groups are useful for creating toolbars,
       segmented button sets, or button-based navigation menus.

       In Bootstrap, the class used for creating a Button Group is .btn-group. This class is applied to a container element (like <div>) that wraps around
      a set of button elements to create the group effect. The .btn-group class is part of Bootstrap's grid system and button styling rules.
